⚔️ Sharpening My Sword 👑
Hey there! I've been diving into the world of programming lately and it's been an exciting journey. I'm especially enjoying front-end development — it's amazing how we can build anything just by manipulating a few attributes of elements within a container.

Taking up a few classes in front-end dev has completely changed the way I see how things work and relate to each other on the web. It's like unlocking a new layer of understanding, and honestly, I'm loving every minute of it.

This portfolio marks my first design, and I'm proud to share it with you. 😌
