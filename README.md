# Sharpening my sword⚔️👑
So I've been learning all this new cool stuff in regards with programming
And man I'm loving it so I took up a few classes in frontend 
Dev and I find it in really neat we can make anything by just 
Manipulating a few attributes of elements within a container 
This also gave me a different perspective of how things really
Work and relate to each othe

Anyways I'm glad I got to do this first design😌
